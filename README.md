| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Property Listing View** | A grid-based display of available properties with powerful filters to help users find the perfect place.                                |
| **Listing Detailed View** | A complete view of a single property, including a photo gallery, detailed descriptions, amenities, and a prominent booking form.        |
| **Simple Checkout View** | A streamlined and secure form for users to enter their payment details and confirm their booking with confidence.                       |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is critical for success. It reduces friction in the user journey, which increases conversion rates and improves overall customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and a responsive design are essential for building trust and encouraging repeat business.### Design Specifications (from Figma)

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, and manages the final deliverables to ensure the project stays on track.
* **Frontend Developers:** Implement all UI components based on the Figma designs, connect the frontend to the backend APIs, and ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.
* **Backend Developers:** Build and maintain the server-side application, design and manage the database schema, and implement the business logic and APIs.
* **Designers:** Create UI mockups and prototypes in Figma, maintain the project's design system, and ensure the final product meets UX quality standards.
* **QA/Testers:** Write and execute test cases, perform manual and automated testing, identify and report bugs, and verify that the application meets all requirements.
* **DevOps Engineers:** Manage the deployment process, set up and maintain the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and oversee the server infrastructure.
* **Product Owner:** Defines the project requirements, prioritizes features in the product backlog, and acts as the primary representative for stakeholder interests.
* **Scrum Master:** Facilitates all agile processes and ceremonies, removes any blockers hindering the team's progress, and organizes team meetings to ensure smooth collaboration.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying and documenting the specific properties of a mock-up design (like colors, fonts, and spacing) is a critical step before development. It establishes a single source of truth for the application's visual identity, ensuring consistency across all components and pages. This practice streamlines the development process, reduces ambiguity for developers, and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application's frontend in the future.------

## Team Roles

Based on the project overview and best practices, here are the key backend roles for this project:

* **Backend Developer:**
    * **Responsibility:** The Backend Developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server, databases, and APIs that power the entire application. They create the "behind-the-scenes" logic that handles user requests, manages data, and ensures the application is functional and performant.
    * **In this project, their duties will include:**
        * Developing the server-side application logic.
        * Building secure and efficient APIs for the frontend to consume.
        * Integrating with third-party services like payment gateways.
        * Ensuring the system can scale to handle many users and bookings.

* **Database Administrator (DBA):**
    * **Responsibility:** The Database Administrator is the custodian of the project's data. They are in charge of designing, implementing, securing, and maintaining the database to ensure data integrity, security, and availability.
    * **In this project, their duties will include:**
        * Designing the logical and physical database schema.
        * Implementing and configuring the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
        * Establishing and testing backup and recovery plans to prevent data loss.
        * Monitoring database performance and tuning queries for speed.
        * Managing user access and permissions to protect sensitive data.

## UI Component Patterns

We will develop a set of reusable, modular, and consistent UI components to build the application's interface efficiently.

### Planned Components

* **Navbar**
    * Logo
    * Search bar
    * User navigation links (e.g., Sign Up, Login, Profile)
    * Responsive menu for mobile views

* **Property Card**
    * Property image or carousel
    * Basic details (e.g., location, price per night, rating)
    * Favorite/Wishlist button
    * Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

* **Footer**
    * Site map links (e.g., About, Careers, Help)
    * Company and legal information
    * Social media links
    * Copyright information

Each component will be designed for reusability and consistency across the application.---

## Technology Stack

This section outlines the core backend technologies chosen for this project and the purpose each one serves.

* **Django:**
    * **Purpose:** Django is a high-level Python web framework that will be used to build the robust and secure backend for our application. Its primary role is to create the RESTful APIs that the frontend will interact with to fetch and manipulate data, such as user profiles, property listings, and bookings.

* **PostgreSQL:**
    * **Purpose:** PostgreSQL will serve as our primary relational database. It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and data integrity. All project data, including user credentials, property details, booking information, and reviews, will be stored and managed within PostgreSQL.

* **GraphQL:**
    * **Purpose:** GraphQL will be used as the query language for our API. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows the frontend application to request exactly the data it needs in a single API call, and nothing more. This leads to highly efficient data transfer, which is crucial for a fast and responsive user experience, especially on mobile devices.
