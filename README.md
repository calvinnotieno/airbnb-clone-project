## Project Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, and manages the final deliverables to ensure the project stays on track.
* **Frontend Developers:** Implement all UI components based on the Figma designs, connect the frontend to the backend APIs, and ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.
* **Backend Developers:** Build and maintain the server-side application, design and manage the database schema, and implement the business logic and APIs.
* **Designers:** Create UI mockups and prototypes in Figma, maintain the project's design system, and ensure the final product meets UX quality standards.
* **QA/Testers:** Write and execute test cases, perform manual and automated testing, identify and report bugs, and verify that the application meets all requirements.
* **DevOps Engineers:** Manage the deployment process, set up and maintain the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and oversee the server infrastructure.
* **Product Owner:** Defines the project requirements, prioritizes features in the product backlog, and acts as the primary representative for stakeholder interests.
* **Scrum Master:** Facilitates all agile processes and ceremonies, removes any blockers hindering the team's progress, and organizes team meetings to ensure smooth collaboration.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying and documenting the specific properties of a mock-up design (like colors, fonts, and spacing) is a critical step before development. It establishes a single source of truth for the application's visual identity, ensuring consistency across all components and pages. This practice streamlines the development process, reduces ambiguity for developers, and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application's frontend in the future.------

## Team Roles

Based on the project overview and best practices, here are the key backend roles for this project:

* **Backend Developer:**
    * **Responsibility:** The Backend Developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server, databases, and APIs that power the entire application. They create the "behind-the-scenes" logic that handles user requests, manages data, and ensures the application is functional and performant.
    * **In this project, their duties will include:**
        * Developing the server-side application logic.
        * Building secure and efficient APIs for the frontend to consume.
        * Integrating with third-party services like payment gateways.
        * Ensuring the system can scale to handle many users and bookings.

* **Database Administrator (DBA):**
    * **Responsibility:** The Database Administrator is the custodian of the project's data. They are in charge of designing, implementing, securing, and maintaining the database to ensure data integrity, security, and availability.
    * **In this project, their duties will include:**
        * Designing the logical and physical database schema.
        * Implementing and configuring the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
        * Establishing and testing backup and recovery plans to prevent data loss.
        * Monitoring database performance and tuning queries for speed.
        * Managing user access and permissions to protect sensitive data.

## UI Component Patterns

We will develop a set of reusable, modular, and consistent UI components to build the application's interface efficiently.

### Planned Components

* **Navbar**
    * Logo
    * Search bar
    * User navigation links (e.g., Sign Up, Login, Profile)
    * Responsive menu for mobile views

* **Property Card**
    * Property image or carousel
    * Basic details (e.g., location, price per night, rating)
    * Favorite/Wishlist button
    * Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

* **Footer**
    * Site map links (e.g., About, Careers, Help)
    * Company and legal information
    * Social media links
    * Copyright information

Each component will be designed for reusability and consistency across the application.---

## Technology Stack

This section outlines the core backend technologies chosen for this project and the purpose each one serves.

* **Django:**
    * **Purpose:** Django is a high-level Python web framework that will be used to build the robust and secure backend for our application. Its primary role is to create the RESTful APIs that the frontend will interact with to fetch and manipulate data, such as user profiles, property listings, and bookings.

* **PostgreSQL:**
    * **Purpose:** PostgreSQL will serve as our primary relational database. It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and data integrity. All project data, including user credentials, property details, booking information, and reviews, will be stored and managed within PostgreSQL.

* **GraphQL:**
    * **Purpose:** GraphQL will be used as the query language for our API. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows the frontend application to request exactly the data it needs in a single API call, and nothing more. This leads to highly efficient data transfer, which is crucial for a fast and responsive user experience, especially on mobile devices.---

## Feature Breakdown

This section details the core features that will be implemented in the backend of the AirBnB Clone project.

* **User Management**
    * This feature will handle all aspects of user authentication and profile management. It will allow users to register for a new account, log in securely, and manage their personal information. This is the foundation of the application, as it enables a personalized and secure experience for every user.

* **Property Management**
    * This feature allows property owners to create, update, and manage their listings. Owners can upload photos, set pricing, describe their property, and specify available dates. This system is essential for populating the platform with accommodations for guests to browse and book.

* **Search and Filtering**
    * This feature will provide users with a powerful search functionality to find properties based on location, dates, number of guests, and other criteria like price range or amenities. A robust search and filtering system is critical for a positive user experience, enabling guests to easily find the perfect place to stay.

* **Booking System**
    * The booking system is the core transactional feature of the application. It will manage the entire booking process, from a user selecting dates and requesting to book, to the owner confirming the reservation and the system blocking out the dates. This ensures a smooth and reliable process for both guests and hosts.

* **Reviews and Ratings**
    * This feature enables users to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This builds trust and community on the platform, as future guests can use this feedback to make informed decisions. It also allows hosts to build a reputation for their properties.
