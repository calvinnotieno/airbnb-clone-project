# airbnb-clone-project

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Project Goals (Learning Objectives)

By completing this project, we aim to:

* Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs.
* Understand how to structure a complex web application.
* Practice working in a team with defined roles.
* Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture.
* Learn best practices for web application development.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
* **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
* Create an intuitive booking flow.
* Maintain visual consistency across the application.
* Ensure fast loading times.
* Prioritize mobile responsiveness.

### Key Features
* Property search and filtering.
* Detailed property viewing.
* A secure checkout process.
* User authentication.

### Primary Pages
| Page                      | Description                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Property Listing View** | A grid-based display of available properties with powerful filters to help users find the perfect place.                                |
| **Listing Detailed View** | A complete view of a single property, including a photo gallery, detailed descriptions, amenities, and a prominent booking form.        |
| **Simple Checkout View** | A streamlined and secure form for users to enter their payment details and confirm their booking with confidence.                       |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is critical for success. It reduces friction in the user journey, which increases conversion rates and improves overall customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and a responsive design are essential for building trust and encouraging repeat business.### Design Specifications (from Figma)

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, and manages the final deliverables to ensure the project stays on track.
* **Frontend Developers:** Implement all UI components based on the Figma designs, connect the frontend to the backend APIs, and ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.
* **Backend Developers:** Build and maintain the server-side application, design and manage the database schema, and implement the business logic and APIs.
* **Designers:** Create UI mockups and prototypes in Figma, maintain the project's design system, and ensure the final product meets UX quality standards.
* **QA/Testers:** Write and execute test cases, perform manual and automated testing, identify and report bugs, and verify that the application meets all requirements.
* **DevOps Engineers:** Manage the deployment process, set up and maintain the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and oversee the server infrastructure.
* **Product Owner:** Defines the project requirements, prioritizes features in the product backlog, and acts as the primary representative for stakeholder interests.
* **Scrum Master:** Facilitates all agile processes and ceremonies, removes any blockers hindering the team's progress, and organizes team meetings to ensure smooth collaboration.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying and documenting the specific properties of a mock-up design (like colors, fonts, and spacing) is a critical step before development. It establishes a single source of truth for the application's visual identity, ensuring consistency across all components and pages. This practice streamlines the development process, reduces ambiguity for developers, and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application's frontend in the future.---

## UI Component Patterns

We will develop a set of reusable, modular, and consistent UI components to build the application's interface efficiently.

### Planned Components

* **Navbar**
    * Logo
    * Search bar
    * User navigation links (e.g., Sign Up, Login, Profile)
    * Responsive menu for mobile views

* **Property Card**
    * Property image or carousel
    * Basic details (e.g., location, price per night, rating)
    * Favorite/Wishlist button
    * Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

* **Footer**
    * Site map links (e.g., About, Careers, Help)
    * Company and legal information
    * Social media links
    * Copyright information

Each component will be designed for reusability and consistency across the application.
